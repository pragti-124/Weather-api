<br>

Building a Weather app with JavaScript is an excellent project for beginners. It helps to understand the core basics of the DOM and teaches how to use fetch API, to call and get data from a third-party service.<br>

This is a simple javascript project made with the help of HTML, CSS, and OpenWeather API. We used weather API to fetch data and display it according to the city entered in the search bar.
